CITS ERMS
=============
## E-ARK Content Information Type Specification for Electronic Records Management Systems

The CITS ERMS have in its latest version 2.1.0 been extended with the textual document as well as undergone some minor changes in the XML-schema. The CITS ERMS are supplied with a supplementary document for understanding the XML-schema as well as the schema generated documentation. 

## Guideline (Primer) for CITS ERMS
This guideline (primer) describes the ERMS specification. Some notes regarding implementation are also present, but, in most cases, these will not be enough to explain how it is conducted in each system because of the complexity of all the systems. The guideline will be an evolving document, and thoroughly explained examples will be added continuously.

## ERMS.xsd
This is the XML-schema supporting the requirements in the specification.

## Erms.sch
This is the Schematron document which extends some of the validation rules within the ERMS.xsd.

## ERMS.pdf
This is the documentation to the XML-schema.
